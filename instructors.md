This section is split into three lessons:

##01 File Organization

###Activity 01 - Forensic Science - 30 minutes 

This section start with an activity to get the students thinking about "excavating" a folder in the future.  It is meant to get the students thinking about what file names, file organization, and file content tell us about a project.  The students are given the folder [01-forensic-science](./files/01-forensic-science) and have the students try to answer questions, while going through the files. *Maybe give them a list of questions and have them try to answer, then discuss to start?- C.M.*

**Questions**

1.  What type of study is this?
2.  What are the conclusions of this study?
3.  When was this study performed?
4.  What are the questions that this study is trying to answer?
5.  Which files are the data? Which files are the analysis?  Should they be seperate?
6.  What are the differences between the data files?
7.  What are the differences between the analysis files?
8.  Are the file formats appropriate?
6.  What are some ways that would make answering these questions easier? Get them to start discussing how they are currently organizing their projects. 

**Guide to the files** - This is in the [README.md](./files/01-forensic-science/README.md) file currently in the [01-forensic-science](./files/01-forensic-science) directory.  This maybe should be removed before it is given to students. ;)
