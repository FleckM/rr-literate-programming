Notes re: a lecture on literate programming by way of explaining RMarkdown

Jenny TO DO

Will build on slides from [a talk at SFU](https://github.com/jennybc/2013-11_sfu) Stats November 2013. Sorry Keynote slides not there :sad: so this work unit will involve porting that info into a better format.

Gaps and changes identified via discussion with @naupaka and Kristina Riemer

Outline of slides *coming momentarily*
