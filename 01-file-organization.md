Please download this directory: 01-forensic-science

It is time to do some forensic science on a scientist from the pasts work.  This is something we all must do at some point as a researcher.  We all have come across this at some point. Either you are given an old labmates work to try and build or reproduce that work. More often than not, the past researcher is yourself!
