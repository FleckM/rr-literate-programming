#### Getting the analysis right is only one link

Process, packaging, and presentation are often the weak links in the chain.

## Markdown

### What is Markdown?
- `Markdown` is a particular type of markup language. Markup languages are designed to produce documents from plain text.
- You may be familiar with `LaTeX`, another (though less human friendly) text markup language.
- Tools render markdown to different formats (for example, HTML/pdf/Word).
  - The main tool for rendering Markdown is [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/).

Adapted from [Carson Sievert's markdown slides](http://cpsievert.github.io/slides/markdown/#/1)

### Markdown enables fast publication to the web
- **Markdown** Easy to write and read in an editor.
- **HTML** Easy to publish and read on web.

### Markdown versus HTML code {.code-columns}

## Medium header <!-- header 2, actually -->

It's easy to do *italics* or __make things bold__.

> All models are wrong, but some are useful. An approximate answer to the right problem is worth a good deal more than an exact answer to an approximate problem.

Code block below. Just affects formatting here.

```
x <- 3 * 4
```

I can haz equations. Inline equations, such as the average is computed as $\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}$. Or display equations like this:


$$
\begin{equation*}
|x|=
\begin{cases} x & \text{if $x\ge 0$,} \\\\
-x &\text{if $x\lt 0$.}
\end{cases}
\end{equation*}
$$

## Markdown can be rendered to multiple formats

## `RMarkdown`

`RMarkdown` is rendered to Markdown {.code-columns}

This is an R Markdown document.

```{r sec_3}
x <- rnorm(1000)
head(x)
```


`knitr` offers a lot of control over representing different types of output. We can also have inline `R` expressions computed on the fly. The mean $\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}$ of the `r length(x)` random variates we generated is `r round(mean(x), 3)`. This figure is computed on-the-fly as well. No more copy-paste, including for figures:

```{r sec_4}
plot(density(x))
```

## Rendering can be automated is thus repeatable
![](../media/knitrButton-screenshot.png)


From within `R`:

`rmarkdown::render("filename.Rmd")`

From the command line:

`$ Rscript -e "rmarkdown::render('filename.Rmd')"`


## Summary
- `RMarkdown` enables ideas and questions, the code that implements them, and the results generated by the implementation, to all stay together.
- `RMarkdown` toolchain allows automated, repeatable rendering
  - for publishing to the web and viewing through a browser
  - and (through `LaTeX`) to obtain a submittable manuscript (in PDF or Word).
- `knitr` is not limited to executing `R` code. See the book Dynamic documents with `R` and `knitr` by Yihui Xie, part of the CRC Press / Chapman & Hall R Series (2013). [ISBN](http://www.isbnsearch.org/isbn/9781482203530)
