## 01 File Naming

### Activity 01 - Forensic Science - 30 minutes 

This section starts with an activity to get the students thinking about "excavating" a folder in the future.  It is meant to get the students thinking about what file names, file organization, and file content and what these can tell us about a project.  The students are given the folder [01-forensic-science](./files/01-forensic-science).  Have the students try to answer questions, while going through the files. Encourage disscussion of strategies they have been taking that have worked or do well in their project management.

**Questions**

1.  What type of study is this?
2.  What are the conclusions of this study?
3.  When was this study performed?
4.  What are the questions that this study is trying to answer?
5.  Which files are the data? Which files are the analysis?  Should they be seperate?
6.  What are the differences between the data files?
7.  What are the differences between the analysis files?
8.  Are the file formats appropriate?
6.  What are some ways that would make answering these questions easier? Get them to start discussing how they are currently organizing their projects. 

**Guide to the files** - This is in the [README.md](./files/01-forensic-science/README.md) file currently in the [01-forensic-science](./files/01-forensic-science) directory. *This maybe should be removed before it is given to students.* ;)
