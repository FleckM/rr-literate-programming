###To-do outline

The [template](https://github.com/Reproducible-Science-Curriculum/Reproducible-Science-Hackathon-Dec-08-2014/wiki/Template-for-lessons) says we split up the lesson into smaller 15 - 30 minute sections.

Maybe this: 

1.  01-file-organization.md  
2.  02-programatic-modification.md 
3.  03-literate-programming.md 
4.  04-input-vs-output.md
